WelcomeCommunity Smart Contract
Welcome to the WelcomeCommunity smart contract â€” a simple yet elegant on-chain utility that tracks and celebrates user interaction within a Web3 community. Designed for the Monad Community, this contract encourages engagement and rewards loyalty with personalized messages.

Overview
The WelcomeCommunity contract is built on Solidity ^0.8.20 and provides:

A warm, programmable welcome message.

A history of user interactions.

A basic incentive mechanism to acknowledge loyal community members.

Contract Features
welcome()
Emits an interaction event every time it's called.

Returns: "Welcome to the Monad Community!"

checkHistory()
Returns a customized string based on the number of interactions.

Over 100: Thanks the user for their loyalty.

Otherwise: Encourages continued engagement.

interactions (mapping)
Publicly viewable record of how many times each address has interacted with the contract.

How It Works
The core logic is centered around a modifier called trackInteraction, which:

Increments the interaction count for msg.sender.

Emits an Interaction event with the updated count.

Wraps around any function (currently welcome) to track user engagement seamlessly.
